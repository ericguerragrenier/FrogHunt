  <h2>Participant Information and Consent Form</h2>
  
  <p>
    <span class="prj">Name of Project:</span>
    How do predators decide which prey to attack based on prior experience?

     <p>
    <span class="prj">Sponsor and disclaimer:</span>
The study is being conducted by Mr Eric Guerra-Grenier (eric.guerra-grenier@mail.mcgill.ca) and Prof David M. Green (david.m.green@mcgill.ca) from the Redpath Museum - McGill University. Mr Guerra-Grenier is a PhD candidate and this research is to be part of his doctoral thesis under the supervision of Prof Green.

  <p>
This research is supported by the Fonds de Recherche du Qu√©bec: Nature et Technologies (FRQNT).

  <p>
    <span class="prj">Purpose of the study:</span>
You are invited to participate in a study of predator-prey relationships. The aim of this study is
to understand how a predator's previous encounters with prey affect responses to future prey encounters. We have chosen to use frogs as prey species since they naturally vary in antipredator strategies.

  <p>
    <span class="prj">Study procedure:</span>
    Participants must be 18+ years of age. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to view a number of images of frogs and tell us if you think they are toxic or not. You will be asked to score a total of 21 images, and the task will take less than 5 minutes. From your responses we will obtain the frequency with which each image is considered to be toxic as well as the time it took each participant to score each image. Please not that this game is only available in English. 

  <p>
    <span class="prj">Voluntary participation:</span>
Your participation is entirely voluntary. You are free to quit the game without completing it and withdraw your data at any time during the experiment, without having to give a reason for withdrawing. If you decide to quit the game during before completion, any electronic copies of your data and information will be deleted. Once the experiment is complete, data will be associated with a unique numeric code and will remain anonymous. At this point withdrawal is no longer possible.

  <p>
    <span class="prj">Questions or concerns?:</span>
If you have any questions, or would like to receive study results, please contact Eric Guerra-Grenier at eric.guerra-grenier@mail.mcgill.ca

 <p>
The ethical aspects of this study have been approved by the McGill University Research Ethics Board (file number _____________). If you have any complaints or reservations about any ethical aspect of your participation in this research, you may contact the McGill Ethics Manager at +1 (514) 398 6831 or lynda.mcneil@mcgill.ca. Any complaint you make will be treated in confidence and investigated, and you will be informed of the outcome.

  <p>
    <span class="prj">Potential risks:</span>
There is only one minimal anticipated risk to you associated with your participation in this research, and it is frustration. As with any game, not getting the scores we want can lead to frustration. We encourage you to play in a relaxed setting. Remember that you are free to leave the game and withdraw from the study at anytime.  

  <p>
    <span class="prj">Potential benefits:</span>
Participating in the study might not benefit you, but we hope that our results will shed light on how predators make decisions based on whatever information is available to them. Furthermore, using a computer game with human participants will allow us to answer our research questions in a way that significantly reduces our impact on natural communities and ecosystems, something that mainstream studies on animal coloration usually struggle to achieve

  <p>
    <span class="prj">Compensation:</span>
Your participation is voluntary.

  <p>
    <span class="prj">Confidentiality:</span>
No identifiable information will gathered in the course of the study, making participation anonymous and confidential. No individual will be identified in any publication of the results. A summary of the results of the data can be made available to you on request via email.
