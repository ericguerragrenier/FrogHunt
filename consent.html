  <h2>Participant Information and Consent Form</h2>
  
  <p>
    <span class="prj">Name of Project:</span>
    How do predators decide which prey to attack based on prior experience?
  <p>
You are invited to participate in a study of predator-prey relationships. The aim of this study is
to understand how a predator's previous encounters with prey affect responses to future prey encounters. We have chosen to use frogs as prey species since they naturally vary in antipredator strategies.

  <p>
The study is being conducted by Mr Eric Guerra-Grenier (eric.guerra-grenier@mail.mcgill.ca) and Prof David M. Green (david.m.green@mcgill.ca) from the Redpath Museum - McGill University, as well as Dr James B. Barnett (barnettj@mcmaster.ca) from the Department of Psychology, Neuroscience and Behaviour - McMaster University.

  <p>
Mr Eric Guerra-Grenier is a PhD candidate and this research is to be part of his doctoral thesis under the supervision of Prof David M. Green, Redpath Museum.

  <p>
This research is supported by the Fonds de Recherche du Qu√©bec: Nature et Technologies (FRQNT).

  <p>
If you decide to participate, you will be asked to view a number of images of frogs and tell us if you think they are toxic or not. You will be asked to score a 
total of 21 images, and the task will take less than 5 minutes. From your responses we will obtain the frequency with which each image is considered to be toxic 
as well as the time it took each participant to score each image.

  <p>
Any information or personal details gathered in the course of the study are confidential, except as required by law. 
No individual will be identified in any publication of the results. A summary of the results of the data can be made available to you on request via email. 
Participation in this study is entirely voluntary: you are not obliged to participate and if you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw at any time without 
having to give a reason and without consequence.

  <p>
The ethical aspects of this study have been approved by the McGill University Research Ethics Board. If you have any complaints or reservations about any ethical aspect of your participation in this research, you may contact the McGill Ethics Manager at +1 (514) 398 6831 or lynda.mcneil@mcgill.ca. Any complaint you make will be treated in confidence and investigated, and you will be informed of the outcome.
