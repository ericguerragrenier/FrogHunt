    <h1>Frog Hunt! A science game where you are a predator!</h1>
    
    <p> Your instincts are telling you to eat frogs. However, you just moved to a new habitat where some frogs are toxic and some are not. 
      
    <p> You have already eaten your first prey, and it made you really sick! We will show it to you soon. You will need to determine if your future prey are toxic or not, based on that first encounter.
    
    <p> You will need to determine if your future meals are safe to eat, based on that first encounter.

    <p class="important">Click the <span class="label">Toxic</span> button if you think your prey is toxic. Click the <span class="label">Not Toxic</span> button if you think it is safe to eat.

      <p> You will need to decide quickly! If you take too long before deciding, your meal will jump away and <span class="important">escape</span>.

      <p> While the frogs you will soon encounter are real examples of toxic vs. palatable species, the aim of this study is to determine if you can guess which ones are which, 
        based on limited information.
